• Multideveloper support - Enable online mode and Sync developer clients together to form a group coding and testing team

## Multideveloper Support
Enabling online mode will host a developer server that friends can connect their developer clients to. 
This gives friends the option to push changes to gamescripts they have made to the developer server. 
Friends can also join the team for playing the game.
This means multiple people can be modifying different gamescripts, sync the gamescript to the server and reload the scripts in-game.
